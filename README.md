#### SRG channels Full HD?
> SRG only provides its FHD signal in H.265 format. This format requires a lot more hardware resources, so it only works smoothly with the latest Apple TV and >Android TV setup boxes. We generally do not use transcoding, but instead focus on the unencrypted transmission of TV signals with our TV7. That is why we do not broadcast these channels in the TV7 app in FHD but only in 720p format. Instead, we provide the signals in FHD as a separate playlist for consumption on a separate player
